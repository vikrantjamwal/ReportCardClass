Report Card Class
====

### Project Overview
In this project the goal is to design and create the structure of a ReportCard Java Class which would allow a school to store a studentâ€™s grades for a particular year. This project will be just a java class, rather than a full Android app. 

### Why this project?
In this project we will learn about custom classes, which are critical to every object-oriented program we will build going forward. It is vital to be able to think about how to design objects which interact with each other and model real-world concepts.

### What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills. They include:

* Designing a custom class
* Creating that class in Java code
* Storing information in an array
* Looping through an array
